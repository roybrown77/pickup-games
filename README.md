# Super Simple AngularJS and RequireJS Application

This demonstrates the simplest possible working configuration of an
AngularJS application that uses RequireJS to load up the files.

## Usage

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/petebacondarwin/super-simple-angularjs-requirejs-app.git
cd super-simple-angularjs-requirejs-app
```

You need to run this project from a webserver (not the file system).
You could try using the simple [http-server](https://npmjs.org/package/http-server),
which can provide a static HTTP server from the command line.

```
npm install -g http-server
http-server
```

Now browse to the URL provided by the server - probably http://localhost:8080.
